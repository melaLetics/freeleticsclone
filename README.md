# freeletics_clone

This project is just for practicing some vue.js 3. 
I will rebuild the app Freeletics if possible, but will not make it work functionally (coach AI will not be implemented).
You only need your training data, which can be requested from support, to get an image of your profile.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
